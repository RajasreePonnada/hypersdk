## DAO-VM
A DAO is an organizational structure that is governed by a set of predefined rules encoded as smart contracts on a blockchain. These rules define the decision-making processes, voting mechanisms, and how the organization operates without the need for a centralized authority or intermediaries.
The purpose of a DAO VM would be to provide a dedicated blockchain runtime environment specifically designed for creating, deploying, and managing DAOs. This VM would include built-in functionalities and primitives tailored for DAO operations, making it easier to develop and interact with decentralized organizations.
Here are some key features and components that a DAO VM could include:

Through Hyper-SDK, the custom VM was built and the subnet was possible on Fuji Testnet and ran a node.

#### DAO Creation and Deployment:

Provide a standardized process for creating and deploying new DAOs on the blockchain.
Define the initial governance rules, voting mechanisms, and organizational structure.
Set up the DAO's treasury and funding mechanisms (e.g., crowdfunding, token sales).


#### Governance and Voting:

Implement secure and transparent voting mechanisms for decision-making within the DAO.
Support different voting models (e.g., token-based voting, quadratic voting, liquid democracy).
Enable proposals submission, discussion, and voting processes.


#### Treasury Management:

Manage the DAO's treasury and funds in a decentralized and transparent manner.
Implement rules and mechanisms for fund allocation, spending, and revenue distribution.
Support integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for investment and yield generation.


#### Membership and Access Control:

Manage DAO members, their roles, and access permissions.
Enable mechanisms for joining and leaving the DAO, as well as reputation or stake-based membership rules.
Implement secure authentication and authorization protocols for DAO interactions.


#### Smart Contract Management:

Facilitate the deployment, upgrading, and management of smart contracts that govern the DAO's operations.
Support modular and composable smart contract architectures for flexibility and extensibility.
Provide mechanisms for secure contract upgrades and bug fixes through governance processes.


#### Interoperability and Integration:

Enable integration with other blockchain networks, protocols, and decentralized applications (dApps).
Support cross-chain communication and asset transfers for collaborative or multi-chain DAOs.
Provide APIs and interfaces for external systems and services to interact with the DAO VM.



By building a dedicated DAO VM using the Hyper-SDK, developers can create a standardized and optimized environment for deploying and managing DAOs. This could simplify the development process, enhance security, and provide a more user-friendly experience for DAO participants and stakeholders.
Additionally, the DAO VM could incorporate best practices, templates, and reusable components for common DAO use cases, such as project funding, community governance, or decentralized finance protocols, further streamlining the development and adoption of DAOs.
